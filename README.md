# Neutron-Stars
In this repository you will find Python codes and data files which are useful in the field of Neutron Stars (NS) physics. The codes can read or create Equations Of State (EOS) and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) system of differential equations in differente cases. The data files which are already in the repository contain the main state-of-the-art nuclear physics EOS and also some others obtained from the Skyrme model.

The codes are explained below:
